# emomacropad
The idea for our hackpad(first project) was emojis.

We LOVE emojis. ðŸ˜›
What if it wasn't so inconvenient to use emojis on your computer? ðŸ˜£
What if you had a custom macropad with your top 6 most used emojis! ðŸ˜¨
Oh wait! That doesn't exist. ðŸ˜­

So we made one. ðŸ˜º
We started with a kicad schematic:

We used a XIAO-RP2040-DIP microcontroller, 3 LEDS, and 6 keys for our top 6 emojis.

We did the pcb next and decided on a 2 by 3 grid for the keys with the microcontroller on one end for easy USB access.

We finished with a 3d model of the top and bottom:

Our posture was notably incredible throughout the whole coding process.

And that was the end of our first project.
